  "summary": "The diff implements most requirements well: LandingPage rebuilt with all seven sections, backend Motoko actor with correct data structures and functions, frontend components for all sections, brand colors/typography, and image references. However, the Three.js/React Three Fiber animated Möbius strip (REQ-2) is notably absent from the HeroSection implementation, which uses only static CSS gradients and blur effects as background decoration.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Add a Three.js / React Three Fiber animated liquid Möbius strip that renders as a looping 3D object with a flowing ripple/shimmer effect using Liquid Silver and Nova Gold metallic materials, placed as the hero's background or centerpiece behind the logo.",
      "reason": "The HeroSection.tsx shows only static CSS radial gradient glows and blur effects as background decoration. There is no import of Three.js, React Three Fiber, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei, or any Canvas/mesh component. No animated Möbius strip geometry is implemented.",

      "requirement": "Ensure the MOBIUS-NOVA logo is used in the navbar as well as the footer.",
      "reason": "The logo is confirmed in the footer (Footer.tsx) but no navbar component appears in the diff. The build request specifies the logo should appear in the navbar/footer, and no Navbar component file was added or modified.",

      "description": "New hook files useTestSiteSubmission.ts and useContactSubmissions.ts were created inside frontend/src/hooks/",
      "reason": "The build constraints explicitly state 'Do not modify files in frontend/src/hooks/'. While these are new files rather than modifications of existing files, the constraint's intent was to protect the hooks directory. The diff adds two new hook files directly into this protected directory.",

      "reason": "REQ-9 specifies only submitTestSiteApplication, submitInvestorInquiry, submitPartnershipInquiry, and query functions. The backend also implements submitGeneralInquiry and a GeneralInquiry type which were not requested.",

      "description": "A migration.mo file was added as a separate Motoko module.",
