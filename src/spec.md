# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace founder expertise messaging with pilot partnership opportunity messaging in the landing page section.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove Navy ET background, veteran-founded, and multi-modal technology differentiation content from seven selected elements in section[5]
- Replace removed content with two new messages: "Seeking first pilot installation partners" and "Pre-commercial prototype stage — be among the first"
- Maintain MOBIUS-NOVA brand styling (Montserrat font, brand colors, typography)

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors will see pilot partnership messaging instead of founder expertise content in the selected section, inviting them to become early installation partners.
