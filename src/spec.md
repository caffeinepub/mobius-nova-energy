# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create navigation pages (About, Technology, Features, Contact) with consistent MOBIUS-NOVA styling and integrate user-provided image renders.

**Planned changes:**
- Create About, Technology, Features, and Contact page components with consistent MOBIUS-NOVA brand styling (Liquid Silver, Nova Gold, Deep Space Black, Cosmic Blue, Solar White colors, Montserrat font, dark gradients)
- Implement React Router for client-side navigation between pages
- Update Footer navigation links to use React Router Link components instead of href anchors
- Integrate user-provided image renders (1000008424.jpg, Screenshot_20260220_141756_Chrome.jpg, Screenshot_20260221_040633_Chrome.jpg, Screenshot_20260221_120848_Chrome.jpg) into appropriate pages
- Display images as static assets from frontend/public/assets/generated directory

**User-visible outcome:** Users can navigate between the landing page and dedicated About, Technology, Features, and Contact pages with consistent styling, and view the integrated image renders on the appropriate pages.
