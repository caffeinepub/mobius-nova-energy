## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the newsletter signup bar and statistics section from the landing page.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the newsletter signup bar displaying "Join our newsletter for energy insights and exclusive offers"
- Remove the statistics section showing "10K+ Installations Worldwide", "99.9% System Uptime", and "50M+ kWh Generated" from the CallToActionSection

**User-visible outcome:** The landing page displays a cleaner layout without the newsletter bar and statistics cards, while maintaining all other sections and the main CTA functionality.
