  "summary": "The diff implements all three requirements: REQ-23 creates four new page components (About, Technology, Features, Contact) with consistent MOBIUS-NOVA styling including brand colors, Montserrat font, dark gradients, and Footer integration; REQ-24 configures TanStack Router with routes for all pages and updates Footer links to use Link components; REQ-25 integrates the three requested images (about-background, technology-hero, contact-header) from frontend/public/assets/generated with responsive styling. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the evidence in the diff.",

The BuildRequest does not mention implementing a functional contact form with input fields, validation, or submission logic. ContactPage.tsx includes useState, handleSubmit, handleChange, and form elements (Input, Textarea, Label, Button) which go beyond the requirement to display images with consistent styling.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly states as a constraint 'Do not modify the Footer component's visual design, only update navigation mechanism.' While routing was updated correctly, the diff shows social media icons (Facebook, X, LinkedIn, Instagram) which represent visual/structural additions not mentioned in the requirements or BuildRequest goals.",
